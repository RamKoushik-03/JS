console.log("Hello World!");

const y = 20;
let x = 10;
var z = 30;
//Dont use var in most cases , since it has function scope
//Use let and const instead

p = 20;
//It will work, but it is not recommended to use undeclared variables

let gg;
//This varible value is undefined, since it is not initialized

console.table([x, y, z, gg]);
